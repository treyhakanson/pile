# Polynomial Linear Regression

Follows the general format of:

```
y = b_0 + b_1 * x_1 + b_2 * x_1^2 + ... + b_n * x_1^n
```

Still has "Linear" in the name because the coefficients are being referred to in this case; regardless of whether the x values are linear or non-linear, the coefficients still have to be linear.

Technically a special case of multiple regression
