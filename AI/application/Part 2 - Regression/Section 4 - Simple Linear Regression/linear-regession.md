# Linear Regression

## Overview

Fitting a simple linear model to a dataset:

```
y = mx + b
```

## Methods

### Ordinary Least Squares

Sums the difference between actually y values (y_i) and expected y values (ŷ_i), squared:

```
∑ (y_i - ŷ_i)^2
```

the model that has the minimum sum of squares is the line of best fit
