/**
	API (Application Programming Interface): A set of tools 
	for building a software application

	On the web, APIs are usually made available via a set of 
	urls which accept and send data via HTTP and TCP/IP
	(internal APIs do not work in this way)

	Endpoint: on the web, this is just a url in the API;
	sometimes one endpoint can do multiple things based
	on the HTTP request headers

	Routing: mapping HTTP requests to content

	req.url will give the url that is being requested by
	the client
