Code Review

Files: /Entity/Spawner
Time: 10 minutes
 * Spawner is a class that adds spawnable items to a queue.
 * When spawning items, it checks to see if the queue has any items then removes them and adds it to the spawned list
 * The spawned list is then used to eventually spawn items in the entities
 * Seems staright forward in accomplishing its goal. The one item is marked as hardcoded doesn't seem like it will be an issue
