Files: State/Enemy/
Author: Trey Hakanson
Time: ~10 minutes
 * Implemented logic behind the enemy rex. Creates the IEnemyStateMachine, RexEnemyStateMachine
 * Rex has several states similar to mario. Once he is hit once he will decrease in size to a smaller version and then once dead he flattens agian.
 * Fairly similar to the original mario statemachine, follows similar design pattern which is efficient and needs no real changes.
 * Different point values handled inside of game1.cs. These point values should probably be handled in a seperate class instead of inside the game
 * file, but as it works as is. Takes advantage of the heuristic scoring
