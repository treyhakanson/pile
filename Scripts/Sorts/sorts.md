# Sorting Alogorithms

## Selection Sort

Iterates over elements to find the minimum, each time moving it to the front of the list.

## Bubble Sort

Makes passes over all values, comparing 2 elements at a time and swapping if needed. Stops once an entire pass has been made without swapping elements.

## Insertion Sort

Removes elements from the list one by one, inserting them in their proper location by checking all the previous elements.

## Merge Sort
