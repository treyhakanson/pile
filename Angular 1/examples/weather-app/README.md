# Angular Web Server

## Overview
a super simple web server written in NodeJS to serve a basic Angular 1 boilerplate. Just run the following command to install dependencies:

`npm run install:all`

Make sure that you have `nodemon` installed globally:

`npm i -g nodemon`

And then start the webserver, which will by default listen to port `8080`:

`npm start`
